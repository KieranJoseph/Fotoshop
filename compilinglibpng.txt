To use libpng, you have to include the library when you compile.

Please note that this is for linux users, and I have no idea how it works on other operating systems.

First, install libpng on the system.  The terminal command is:
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev

The terminal will ask for your password.

During the install, the terminal will prompt you with a yes/no question.  Type y to proceed with the install.

The terminal command to compile code that uses libpng is:
g++ -Wall example.cpp -lpng -o example.out

-lpng is -l (library) png (libpng)
